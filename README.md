## Open Hosting Control Panel - OpenHCP GUI

Assumptions:
- free / libre (ISC License) control panel for hosting
- only HTML + JavaScript - can be served from RO drive

Plans (it's easier to say what is done...):
- ReactJS
- use of templates for GUI

## How to install (scripts will replace your packages and configs - you have been warned!)

1. git clone https://github.com/OpenHCP/OpenHCP-GUI.git
2. copy js/config.sample.js to js/config.js and specify there your OpenHCP API URI (use TLS, Luke!)
3. put everything to directory accessible via HTTP(s!)

## features (what is working now)

- nothing that I know of... :P
